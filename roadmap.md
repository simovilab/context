# SIMOVI Roadmap Overview

> The Intelligent Mobility Systems Lab (SIMOVI, _Laboratorio de Sistemas Inteligentes de Movilidad_) of the University of Costa Rica works with digital technologies applied to data collection and analysis of mobility systems and public transportation in particular, with a focus on information systems.

This document outlines our approach to the [SIMOVI Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/simovilab/projects/2). Here, you'll find our guiding principles and a breakdown of the key areas we are focused on for development. Our roadmap is not a static list but a dynamic set of priorities that are tracked live in our GitHub Issues.

> [!NOTE]
> This document is heavily influenced by the [Google Gemini CLI](https://github.com/orgs/google-gemini/projects/11/views/21) project's roadmap.

All repositories are [Apache 2.0 open source projects](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), so we appreciate and welcome public contributions in the corresponding repositories, and will give first priority to those contributions aligned with our roadmap and research interests. If you want to propose a new feature or change to our roadmap, please start by opening an issue for discussion.

## Disclaimer

This roadmap represents our current thinking and is for informational purposes only. It is not a commitment or a guarantee of future delivery. The development, release, and timing of any features are subject to change, and we may update the roadmap based on internal discussions, previous commitments as well as when our priorities evolve.

## Design Principles

> [!NOTE]
> Please check all design principles in its [main page](PRINCIPLES.md).

Our development is by several principles, which can be summarized as follows:

- **Standard-based:** All architectural and data decisions are backed up by international references, specifications or standards in the field. If no reference exists, an effort will be made to create one that follows as much as possible other similar
- **Interoperability:** As a system-of-systems, an intelligent transportation system must ensure on every step its capability to work alongside other implementations through appropriate interfaces and data schemas.
- **Free and Open Source:** Our research is open to the community to help in the development of intelligent mobility systems.

## How the Roadmap Works

Our roadmap is managed directly through GitHub Issues in our organization repositories. This approach ensures transparency and provides direct access to learn about or participate in specific research initiatives. All roadmap items are tagged with Type:`Research` and Label:`active` for ongoing projects, or Type:`Development` and Label:`planned` for future implementations.

Issues are organized to provide key information at a glance:

- **Research Phase:** `Milestone` indicates the current stage (Literature Review, Data Collection, Analysis, Implementation, Publication).
- **Research Area:** Labels such as `area/gtfs`, `area/analytics`, or `area/mobile-apps` categorize the work.
- **Issue Hierarchy:** _Research Programs_ => _Projects_ => _Tasks_ => _Implementations_

To see our current research activities, you can filter issues by these dimensions in our project boards.

## Research Focus Areas

Our research efforts are organized into key areas that align with intelligent mobility systems and transportation informatics. These labels help identify and categorize our research initiatives:

- **GTFS and Transit Data:** Research on General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS), GTFS-Realtime, and related transit data standards for improved public transportation information systems.
- **Data Analytics:** Application of data science and machine learning techniques to transportation data for pattern recognition, demand forecasting, and system optimization.
- **Interoperability:** Research on data exchange protocols and standards that enable different transportation systems to work together effectively.
- **Accessibility:** Studies on inclusive design and accessibility features in transportation information systems.
- **Real-time Systems:** Development of real-time data processing and distribution systems for transit operations and passenger information.
- **Geographic Information Systems (GIS):** Integration of spatial analysis and mapping technologies in transportation research.
- **User Experience Research:** Studies focused on transportation information interfaces and user behavior.
- **Open Data Standards:** Research and development of open standards for transportation data sharing and publication.
- **System Integration:** Research on integrating various transportation data sources and systems into cohesive intelligent mobility platforms.

## How to Collaborate

SIMOVI is an open research laboratory, and we welcome collaboration from the academic community, industry partners, and transportation agencies! Whether you're a researcher, developer, student, or transportation professional, there are many ways to get involved:

- **Research Collaboration:** Review our active research projects and identify areas where your expertise could contribute. Academic partnerships and joint research proposals are particularly welcome.
- **Data Sharing:** If you have access to transportation datasets or can facilitate data collection, we're interested in establishing data sharing agreements for research purposes.
- **Report Issues:** Found problems with our tools or datasets? Create detailed issue reports with data samples and context to help us improve our research outputs.
- **Suggest Research Directions:** Have ideas for new research areas or methodologies? We welcome discussions about emerging topics in intelligent mobility systems.
- **Contribute Code:** Check out our repositories for implementation opportunities. We maintain coding standards focused on research reproducibility and data quality.
- **Academic Writing:** Collaborate on research publications, conference presentations, and technical documentation.
- **Student Projects:** We offer opportunities for undergraduate and graduate student research projects aligned with our roadmap.

We are excited about advancing the field of intelligent mobility systems and look forward to collaborating with the broader research and transportation community!
